            <p class="medium-text display">We work with the refugee community to co-design innovative models of education. </p>
            <p>During 2018, over 100 young people were involved in the design and prototyping of Agora programmes, as well as 20 online educators, local organisations and scholarship providers.</p>
            <p>More than 100 students and 7 local community centres are now involved in testing programming on key skills and academic guidance in Jordan, Lebanon and the UK.</p>

            <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p class="medium-text display">Working with refugee students we produce online content that provides peer advicefor the challenges faced accessing and succeeding at university.</p>
            <p>A team of Syrian student volunteers help shape content series to cover significant issues or needs facing Syrian students and help to identify peer stories.</p>
            <p>Agora facilitates the production of podcasts, videos and written pieces, which are then distributed online, including our 100 facebook community.</p>
            <p>Initial feedback from students found that 65% felt more confident after listening or watching Agora content. In September 2018 we started to leverage this static content for two programmes: in-person academic guidance workshops and facebook live events.</p>

            <h2>Partnerships</h2>
            <p class="medium-text display">We partner with universities, local NGOs and ed-tech.</p>

            <p>During early design sessions held with refugees, unsurprisingly english was a priority, specifically conversation practice and opportunities for social or informal learning.</p>
            <p>To respond to this need, we developed a model of facilitated conversation classes for Syrian, Sudanese, Iraqi and Yemeni refugees in Jordan. Based on dialogic teaching methods and facilitated by a volunteer english teacher, the class allows for extensive speaking practice through student-led topics and class objectives, ensuring content is relevant to their own context.</p>
            <p>Classroom activities are complemented by a partnership with Busuu - a language learning app with 80m+ users - to provide free premium access to Agora students. This complements the methods of the class by opening up offline mobile independent study as well as conversations with native speakers via the platform.</p>
